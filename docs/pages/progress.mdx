# Progress

Please don't hesitate to [ask](https://github.com/0xpolarzero/savvy/issues) if you have any questions or suggestions, or if you would like a feature to be prioritized!

        use savvy as a browser "extension"/wallet; basically override the
        injected provider with the impersonated caller, and override the chain
        with a fresh forkâ€”think of it as a "sandbox" mode for a DApp (see{' '}

And a lot of other possibilities, although not prioritized because there are already great tools for most of these. Like:

- replicate transactions locally (given their hash + chain);
- debug transactions by exploring state change;
- copy a set of local transactions to get the multicall data and execute them on mainnet.
