# Progress

Please don't hesitate to [ask](https://github.com/0xpolarzero/savvy/issues) if you have any questions or suggestions, or if you would like a feature to be prioritized!

<Steps className="relative">
  <Step title="Core" titleLevel={5}>
    <ProgressList>
      <ProgressItem completed={true} difficulty={3}>
        run transactions in a simulated environment and remember activity on
        each chain
      </ProgressItem>
      <ProgressItem completed={true} difficulty={2}>
        mock network condition/congestion (gas/blob gas price)
      </ProgressItem>
      <ProgressItem completed={true} difficulty={2}>
        estimate gas fees on EVM L1s, Polygon and OP-stack L2s
      </ProgressItem>
      <ProgressItem completed={true} difficulty={0}>
        aggregate total fees, include/exclude transactions
      </ProgressItem>
      <ProgressItem completed={false} difficulty={1}>
        support Arbitrum orbit for gas fee on L1 submission
      </ProgressItem>
      <ProgressItem completed={false} priority difficulty={0}>
        wallet/social login to save transactions (sync with local storage)
      </ProgressItem>
    </ProgressList>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Additional features" titleLevel={5}>
    <ProgressList>
      <ProgressItem completed={false} priority difficulty={1}>
        provide helpers to generate mock data and quickly estimate costs for
        selected optimized solutions (e.g. GasliteDrop)
      </ProgressItem>
      <ProgressItem completed={false} difficulty={0}>
        run a tx on multiple chains and provide a comparative estimation of gas
        spent on each
      </ProgressItem>
    </ProgressList>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Core extensions" titleLevel={5}>
    <ProgressList>
      <ProgressItem completed={false} difficulty={2}>
        paste a contract in a browser editor, deploy it and use it just like a
        regular forked contract
      </ProgressItem>
      <ProgressItem completed={false} difficulty={3}>
        run ast on a pasted contract and provide inline recommendations to
        optimize both dependencies (e.g. OZ -> Solady) and known inefficient
        patterns
      </ProgressItem>
      <ProgressItem completed={false} difficulty={3}>
        provide selected secure and optimized contracts to deploy in a click
        with mock data + estimate costs (e.g. Gaslite core, Solady libs)
      </ProgressItem>
    </ProgressList>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Breaking" titleLevel={5}>
    <ProgressList>
      <ProgressItem completed={false} difficulty={-1}>
        provide a rpc to publish tests to the Tevm forked chain and keep the
        state (already possible in the opposite way; fork a local Hardhat node
        to which tests can be published)
      </ProgressItem>
      <ProgressItem completed={false} difficulty={1}>
        separate between two versions: advanced (intended for devs) and
        "onboarding" for non-crypto natives, with detailed explanations,
        guidance and examples
      </ProgressItem>
    </ProgressList>
  </Step>
</Steps>

And a lot of other possibilities, although not prioritized because there are already great tools for most of these. Like:

- replicate transactions locally (given their hash + chain);
- debug transactions by exploring state change;
- copy a set of local transactions to get the multicall data and execute them on mainnet.
