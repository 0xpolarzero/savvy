# Roadmap

Please don't hesitate to [ask](https://github.com/0xpolarzero/savvy/issues) if you have any questions or suggestions, or if you would like a feature to be prioritized!

<RoadmapList>
  <RoadmapItem completed={true}>
    run transactions in a simulated environment and remember activity on each
    chain
  </RoadmapItem>
  <RoadmapItem completed={true}>mock network condition/congestion</RoadmapItem>
  <RoadmapItem completed={true}>
    estimate gas fees on EVM L1s, Polygon and OP-stack L2s
  </RoadmapItem>
  <RoadmapItem completed={false} priority>
    provide helpers to generate mock data and quickly estimate costs for
    selected optimized solutions (e.g. GasliteDrop)
  </RoadmapItem>
  <RoadmapItem completed={false}>
    run a tx on multiple chains and provide a comparative estimation of gas
    spent on each
  </RoadmapItem>
  <RoadmapItem completed={false}>
    support Arbitrum orbit for gas fee on L1 submission
  </RoadmapItem>
  <RoadmapItem completed={false}>
    paste a contract in a browser editor, deploy it and use it just like a
    regular forked contract
  </RoadmapItem>
  <RoadmapItem completed={false}>
    run ast on a pasted contract and provide inline recommendations to optimize
    both dependencies (e.g. OZ -> Solady) and known inefficient patterns
  </RoadmapItem>
  <RoadmapItem completed={false}>
    provide selected secure and optimized contracts to deploy in a click with
    mock data + estimate costs (e.g. Gaslite core, Solady libs)
  </RoadmapItem>
  <RoadmapItem completed={false}>
    provide a rpc to publish tests to the Tevm forked chain and keep the state
    (already possible in the opposite way; fork a local Hardhat node to which
    tests can be published)
  </RoadmapItem>
  <RoadmapItem completed={false} priority>
    wallet/social login to save transactions (sync with local storage)
  </RoadmapItem>
  <RoadmapItem completed={false} priority>
    separate between two versions: advanced (intended for devs) and "onboarding"
    for non-crypto natives, with detailed explanations, guidance and examples
  </RoadmapItem>
</RoadmapList>

And a lot of other possibilities, although not prioritized because there are already great tools for most of these. Like:

- replicate transactions locally (given their hash + chain);
- debug transactions by exploring state change;
- copy a set of local transactions to get the multicall data and execute them on mainnet.
