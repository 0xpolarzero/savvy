# Using locally

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components and design, as well as the overall project's organization. It is intended for use with the Next.js (13+) [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).

The minimal steps to get started are as follows.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to this directory

```bash
git clone git@github.com:0xpolarzero/savvy.git && cd savvy
```

2. Install the dependencies (preferably with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io))

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn
```

```bash [npm]
npm install
```

```bash [bun]
bun install
```

:::

## Setup

3. Copy the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the required environment variables

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then edit .env.local

```txt [.env.local.example]
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=""
COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=""
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=""
ARBISCAN_API_KEY=""
BASESCAN_API_KEY=""
OPTIMISTIC_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=""
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=""
```

We're using Alchemy for better modularity [when creating providers](https://github.com/0xpolarzero/savvy/tree/main/src/lib/constants/providers.ts#L49) and [Tevm clients](https://github.com/0xpolarzero/savvy/tree/main/src/lib/tevm/client.ts#L42), but you can replace it with any other provider, and update the way urls are created in the two aforementioned files.

## Running

4. Run the development server

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

```bash [bun]
bun dev
```
